# TreeOfLife

This project reads a file and assigns each string( an organism) separated by spaces to a tree node which places it in relation to the previous node. The main method then recursively prints the contents of the tree so that the viewer can differentiate between KINGDOM, PHYLUM, CLASS, ORDER, FAMILY, GENUS, and SPECIES.

In order to for the method to run without errors, you must have set HW6Input.txt to args[0] in the JVM settings.
